- adding in t counts per qubit to improve mapping/routing
- structural_mapping_algorithm: sorting positions by max vs. min distance to
  factory
- getting cost from mapping+routing: for a given hardware, cycle time + number
  of operation layers => total time cost (can try with different cycle times!)
