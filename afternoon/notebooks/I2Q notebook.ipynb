The advantage of working with the wide surface code qubit is that it lets us perform all single qubit Clifford operations classically via a procedure called Edge tracking. This effectively eliminates the time overhead of all single qubit Clifford gates. Thus, we just need to worry about the CNOT gate (a two-qubit Clifford gate), and the T gate (non-Clifford gate). \n",

Then, we get rid of all single qubit Clifford operations because of our edge-tracking assumption"

    "We have obtained the mapping now. We know the co-ordinates of the logical qubit patches that the circuit qubits would be mapped to. The next step is to determine how the CNOTs and T gates would be executed. Both CNOTs and T gate execution require lattice surgery which involves initializing an ancilla patch between the control and target qubits. For any two ancilla patches, their ancilla patches cannot intersect (i.e. there cannot be a qubit which is common to multiple ancilla patches in the same time step). We also want to minimize the length of these ancilla patches so that the chances of crossover between two ancilla patches is minimized. Hence the problem of routing essentially translates to that of finding the set of shortest non-intersecting ancilla patches for all operations occuring in the same time step. \n",
